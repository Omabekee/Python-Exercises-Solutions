# Python-Exercises-Solutions
I opened this repo to document my progress on my Python learning journey.
This repo consists of solutions to the programming exercises for [Starting Out With Python] (https://www.amazon.com/Starting-Out-Python-Tony-Gaddis/dp/0134444329) Book By Tony Gaddis.
The Programming Exercises solved include **if-else** loops, **while** loops, **for** loops, **Functions**, **Lists** and **Dictionaries**, which are ordered by **Chapter**.

Side Note: If you're starting out Python and you need help with some codes, you can clone the repo to your directory and run the solutions. If you have any questions(s), here's my email [chiomabonyido@gmail.com] (chiomabonyido@gmail.com)
